    <h1>Page Structure</h1>
    <h2>Head Element</h2>
    <p>The first thing that you will implement into your code after you declare your Doctype is your Head element. Within this head element you are going to create a meta tag and the attribute will be charset equal to the value of utf-8. So, it would look like (left angle bracket)meta charset="utf-8"(right angle bracket). You will also include the title of your page within this part of the document as well.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Right after the closing head tag, we will create a body tag to place all over our content within. If we type somethiing within our body it will come out just as text with no style. We must remember that CSS controls our styling. We can structure this texy by using the tag H1 which will give it a default setting for the format. We also ahve paragragh tags that are simply represented by (left bracket)p(right bracket) </p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is the beginning that you need to be able to slowly begin to talk about the structure of an HTMl document. Next we wil talk about Formatting Pages</p>
